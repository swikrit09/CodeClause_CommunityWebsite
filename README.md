    Search Functionality: The website may offer a search functionality to allow users to search for questions based on specific keywords or tags.

    User Authentication : This website has user authentication features, such as user registration and login, to manage user access and permissions. This provides that the user can only ask a question or answer a question if and only if he/she is registered to the website

Technologies used in this project are:

    Node.js: The backend of the application is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.

    Express: Express is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building server-side applications. It is used to handle routing, middleware, and other functionalities related to HTTP requests and responses.

    MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store and manage the application's data. In this project, it is used to store user registration data and questions with their answers.

    Mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution for modeling application data and interacting with MongoDB.

    bcryptjs: bcryptjs is a library used for hashing and comparing passwords. It is commonly used to securely store user passwords in the database.

    Express-session: Express-session is a middleware used to manage user sessions in the application. It helps in maintaining user authentication and keeping track of user data during their visit.

    HTML, CSS, JavaScript: These are the standard front-end technologies used to build the user interface and implement client-side functionalities in the web application.

    Handlebars (hbs): Handlebars is a templating engine used to generate dynamic HTML pages. It allows developers to define reusable templates and inject dynamic data into HTML files.

    Git: Git is a version control system used to track changes in the project's source code and collaborate with other developers.

    The technologies used in this project follow the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) with Handlebars as the templating engine instead of Angular for the front-end.
